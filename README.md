# How do I approach designing software?

  When I approach designing software, I use a very systematic approach, first considering the requirements and goals of the software. This course, in particular, has helped me to gain skills with graphics programming using OpenGL. Specifically, I learned how to do each of the tasks I would need for this project, such as how to create an OpenGL window, create meshes, objects, textures, lights, etc. After doing this, I analyzed the scene I was trying to create and realized I would need multiple cubes. So I decided to make a function that would allow me to create cubes. I used this mesh for many different objects in the scene, positioned and scaled differently. Tactics, such as this, are useful for understanding all of the processes that will be needed for a particular application.

# How do I approach developing programs?

  I certainly worked on this project in iterations. I went through several iterations of development before reaching competeion of the project. Watching the evolution of my code is interesting because as I learned more and more about using OpenGL, entire segments of the code have been completely rewritten since earlier iterations to better suit the application's needs.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  Understanding more about the technology we all use on a daily basis and how it works and does the things it does gives me an added insight into one of the greatest, if not the greatest, part of modern society. Having a greater understanding of technology gives us more power in this new modern age that we live in.
